What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Initializing a repository is like the same as creating a new folder. No commits are made, no programs are created, simply
a new repository is made and ready for manipulations. This is necessary to begin working on a new project and keep its
contents within the same place so that things are not lost and programs run as intended.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? what value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is just a temporary place to move files that are ready for commitment to changes while working
directories are where those commitments are finally stored and the repository stores everything involoving your program
edits.
