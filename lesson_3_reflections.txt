When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- You want to create a remote repository when you want to share your code amongst the public coding community on github.
It is a good idea to share that code when you want to work with a group of people on one single project. That group can offer changes to
the code that you can review and collaborate what you want to implement into the master copy. Keeping work locally only lets you access
your code.
