This is my first time launching the notepad application via the command prompt on git bash.
The course instructed me to create a text file reflecting my thoughts thus far in the course.
From what I am understanding, git bash has the capability to compare to files and spot small differences between them.
This can be especially useful when making edits to old code and spotting the bugs of the new code.
This would have been especially helpful when I was doing my CS courses and learning to program.
I also should have listened to my father since he basically knew that I would be using git at some point in my life.
I digress, FC is the command used by the command prompt in windows to spot differences between two files (hence its name,
File Compare). As this makes debugging code so much easier, I will certainly use this program to begin developing the code
necessary to start this app. God help me.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-git log displays each and every commit made between changes and their custom descriptions. This is useful to keep track 
of the changes made and the description can help keep the user update with what changes were made at the time of committing
-git diff tracks the difference between two commits. That way, the user can explore the change between two commits and
then pinpoint what changes were made and were bugs may lie in the code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-It allows you to experiment with changes to your code while being able to refer to old code that may have worked as
intended. Therefore, you can certainly try adding additional features to your program that would be more desirable in than
the previous version but also have a reference to what changes were made by comparing the original code to your new code.
